### Send Emails with NODE - Free SMTP Service of Send in Blue

I have used Send in Blue SMTP Service to send emails in NODE Application, and it is sending emails correctly-
Send in Blue is really a cool service, i love in first sight :p We can send 300/emails per day, which is really enough for testing and we can also use theri premium plans as well. Its integration in application is really simple so I would highly recommmend everyone to use this service once.

Thanks Sib!
